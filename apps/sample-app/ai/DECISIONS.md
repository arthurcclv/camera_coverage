# DECISIONS.md — sample-app

Notable technical decisions for the demo app and their trade-offs. Behavior is
defined in [`../specs/spec.md`](../specs/spec.md); this records *why* the code is
shaped the way it is. Newest at the top when you add to this file.

## Spec-first, like the rest of the repo

The app is implemented from `specs/spec.md` (+ `specs/volumetric_rendering.md`),
which is the source of truth. Behavior changes update the spec first and get
approval before implementation — see [WORKFLOWS.md](./WORKFLOWS.md) and the root
`CLAUDE.md`.

## React owns state; Three.js objects are dumb sinks (no react-three-fiber)

**Decision:** React `useState` in `App.tsx` holds the canonical data; `scene/*`
objects are plain Three.js classes updated imperatively via
`update()`/`setOptions()` inside effects, with `useRef` mirrors bridging live
state into imperative callbacks. **Why:** the SDK and Three.js are inherently
imperative and stream results through callbacks; wrapping them in a declarative
scene-graph library (r3f) would fight both. **Trade-off:** manual synchronization
between React state and scene objects, accepted for a reference demo.

## Two independent WebGPU surfaces, each with its own fallback

**Decision:** the Three.js **render** backend (`WebGPURenderer`, main thread) and
the SDK **compute** backend (worker) are chosen and fall back independently —
render → WebGL2, compute → CPU reference — and both are surfaced in the stats
panel. **Why:** they are genuinely different subsystems; forcing them to agree
would hide useful information and couple two unrelated fallbacks.

## Single Three.js instance via a Vite alias

**Decision:** `vite.config.ts` aliases bare `three` → `three/webgpu`
(regex matches the exact specifier only). **Why:** the renderer needs the
`three/webgpu` build (`WebGPURenderer` + node/TSL system); without the alias,
`buildRoom`, the gizmos, and addons (OrbitControls/TransformControls) would pull
in a *second* core `three` copy — breaking cross-build interop and doubling the
bundle. `three/webgpu`, `three/tsl`, and `three/addons/*` resolve normally.

## Volumetric overlay: instanced cubes + TSL, order-independent

**Decision:** one `InstancedMesh` of a unit cube, one instance per voxel, with
per-instance `center`/`half`/`intensity`/`color` as `InstancedBufferAttribute`s
(grown by doubling); a TSL node material slab-tests the view ray per fragment to
get a chord through each voxel. **Why:** a single draw call for the whole overlay,
compiling to WGSL or GLSL from one shader. Rendered `depthWrite:false`,
`side: BackSide`, `frustumCulled:false` so it needs no sorting/OIT and survives
the camera being inside the fog. **Two composite modes** exist — `additive`
(soft, uses chord) and `max` (hard cubes, chord dropped); **`max` is the default
and the app does not expose a UI toggle** for it. A pure-TS reference
(`slabChord`, `voxelContribution`, `compositeContributions`) is the tested truth
the TSL graph mirrors.

## Auto-run as a throttled poll

**Decision:** a 10 Hz `setInterval` fires a recompute when inputs are stale and
the engine is idle/error-free, rather than recomputing synchronously on every
slider tick; the voxel-size input is additionally debounced 250 ms. **Why:**
implements the spec §8.1 throttle and keeps dragging smooth without flooding the
worker.

## Probes read retained run results, not fresh raycasts

**Decision:** per-point visibility is decoded from the retained masks of the most
recent completed run, against a snapshot of that run's enabled-camera id list
(`probeVisibility.ts` decodes all mask words up to 128 cameras). **Why:** reuses
the authoritative engine result instead of a parallel, possibly-divergent client
raycast. **Trade-off:** results can go stale after inputs change — the UI shows a
stale hint and a "recompute" prompt.

## Buffers are cloned before load

`initAndLoad` clones the room mesh's typed arrays before `loadScene`, because the
SDK transfers them across the worker boundary and would otherwise detach the
app's copy.

## Known code/spec notes

- The stale badge reads "Recompute — inputs changed" (spec says just
  "Recompute").
- `CoverageOverlay.addChunk` assumes `camWords === 1` (≤ 32 cameras) for its
  popcount; probe visibility correctly decodes all words up to 128. The demo's 10
  cameras keep the overlay within that assumption.
- The volumetric composite mode `max` is the built-in default with no UI toggle;
  only overlay mode / color / intensity are user-facing.

# Sample App — Camera Coverage SDK Demo

A browser demo of [`@linkervision/camera-coverage-sdk`](../../../packages/camera-coverage-sdk/).
It loads an enclosed room with box obstacles and 10 cameras, lets the user adjust
each camera's position / rotation / FOV, runs the coverage calculation on demand,
and visualizes the result as a color-coded voxel overlay in the scene.

---

## 1. Goals & scope

- Demonstrate the SDK end-to-end: `init` → `loadScene` → `setSampling` →
  `setCameras` → `compute`, with results streamed and visualized.
- Keep the scene small enough that the **CPU reference compute backend** stays
  responsive, while still exercising the **WebGPU compute** path where available
  (distinct from the WebGPU *render* backend, §2.3).
- Be a readable reference for SDK consumers, not a polished product.

Non-goals: saving/loading scenes, importing external meshes, multi-scene support,
authentication, mobile layout.

## 2. Tech stack & project wiring

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| Bundler / dev server | **Vite** + TypeScript |
| UI | **React** — control panels, buttons, stats readouts |
| 3D rendering | **Three.js `WebGPURenderer`** (`three/webgpu`) with **TSL** node materials and automatic WebGL2 fallback (§2.3). Driven imperatively inside a `useEffect`/ref (no react-three-fiber) |
| SDK dependency | Referenced **by name** (`@linkervision/camera-coverage-sdk`) via npm workspaces |

### 2.1 Monorepo

Add a root `package.json` at the repo root:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "camera-coverage-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
```

`apps/sample-app/package.json` declares `"@linkervision/camera-coverage-sdk": "*"`.
A single `npm install` at the root symlinks the package into `node_modules`; Vite
imports it by name through the package `exports` map. The SDK's internal specifiers
use explicit `.ts` extensions — Vite/esbuild resolve these without extra config.

### 2.3 Render backend

The viewport renders with Three.js's **`WebGPURenderer`** (`three/webgpu`), chosen for
throughput on the volumetric overlay's heavy additive overdraw (§9;
[`volumetric_rendering.md`](./volumetric_rendering.md)).

- It **prefers WebGPU** and **automatically falls back to its WebGL2 backend** when
  `navigator.gpu` is unavailable, so the demo always renders through one code path.
- The overlay's custom shader is authored in **TSL** node materials, which compile to
  **WGSL** on the WebGPU backend and **GLSL** on the WebGL2 backend — one shader, both
  backends.
- `WebGPURenderer` initializes **asynchronously** (`await renderer.init()` before the
  first frame); viewport setup accounts for this.

**Two independent "WebGPU"s.** This render backend is distinct from the SDK's WebGPU
**compute** backend (§3.2): the renderer draws on the main thread, the compute backend
runs the coverage calculation in the worker. They are selected and reported (§10)
separately, and each may independently be WebGPU or its fallback.

---

## 3. Compute execution model

### 3.1 Web Worker

Compute runs off the main thread so the viewport stays interactive and progress
state can animate.

- `src/worker.ts`:

  ```ts
  import { installHost, messageTransport } from '@linkervision/camera-coverage-sdk';
  installHost(messageTransport(self as any));
  ```

- Main thread:

  ```ts
  const engine = WorkerClient.fromWorker(
    new Worker(new URL('./worker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' }),
  );
  ```

`compute({ onChunkDone })` streams each `ChunkResult` back to the main thread,
where the overlay is (re)built.

### 3.2 Backend selection

1. Try `engine.init({ ...workspace, backend: 'auto' })`.
2. On any failure (e.g. `WEBGPU_UNAVAILABLE`), re-`init` with `backend: 'cpu'`.
3. Display the resolved backend from the returned `GpuCapabilities.backend`
   ("WebGPU" / "CPU") in the UI.

> Note: the SDK README flags the WebGPU path as written-to-spec but not
> runtime-validated; the CPU path is the tested reference. The fallback guarantees
> the demo always runs.

## 4. Scene

### 4.1 Geometry

An enclosed rectangular room, **open top**, plus freestanding box obstacles:

- Room interior ≈ **20 (X) × 20 (Z) × 6 (Y, height)** meters. Y is up (glTF Y-up).
- Floor + 4 walls (no ceiling, so the orbit camera can see in). Walls have
  non-zero thickness (built as boxes) so they read as solid geometry.
- **4–6 box obstacles** of varying size/position on the floor, tall enough to
  create occlusion shadows.

A single indexed triangle mesh (`positions: Float32Array`, `indices: Uint32Array`,
world space, meters) is produced by `buildRoom.ts` and used for **both**:

- rendering in Three.js (as the room + box meshes), and
- `engine.loadScene({ positions, indices })`.

### 4.2 Workspace

`WorkspaceConfig` passed to `init`:

- `worldMin` / `worldMax` — the room's AABB (with a small margin).
- `voxelSize` — see §6.
- `chunkSizeXZ` — `10` (default).

---

## 5. Cameras

- **10 cameras**, `MAX_CAMERAS` is 128 so well within range.
- Default placement: CCTV-style around the room perimeter, mounted high near the
  wall tops, angled inward and downward. Defined in `cameras/defaults.ts`.
- Per-camera config maps to `CameraConfig`:
  `{ id, position, rotation (quat xyzw), fov (vertical°), aspect (16/9), near (0.1), far (~30) }`.

### 5.1 Rotation representation

- The **quaternion is the source of truth** stored per camera.
- The panel exposes **Euler yaw / pitch / roll** sliders, converted to/from the
  quaternion (`cameras/math.ts`). The TransformControls gizmo writes the
  quaternion directly; the Euler sliders are re-derived for display.

### 5.2 Editing interaction

- **Select** a camera by clicking its frustum gizmo in the viewport or its row in
  the camera list.
- **Panel sliders** edit the selected camera: position X/Y/Z, yaw/pitch/roll, FOV.
- **TransformControls** gizmo (translate + rotate modes) on the selected camera in
  the viewport, kept in two-way sync with the panel.

### 5.3 Frustum gizmos

Each camera renders as a frustum wireframe reflecting its `fov`/`aspect`/`far`, so
aim and coverage volume are visible. The selected camera's gizmo is highlighted.
A disabled camera's gizmo is dimmed and its frustum wireframe hidden (§5.4).

### 5.4 Enable / disable

- Each row in the camera list has a **checkbox toggle** to enable/disable that
  camera, independent of selection. Toggling doesn't change the current selection.
- Disabled cameras stay in the scene (dimmed gizmo, no frustum wireframe) and keep
  their position/rotation/FOV editable, but are **excluded from `setCameras()`**
  passed to the engine, so they don't participate in `compute()` — no coverage
  rate is reported for them and they can't be flagged as `CAMERA_INSIDE_GEOMETRY`.
- Toggling a camera marks the result stale, same as any other camera edit (§8.1).
- The overlay's coverage-fraction denominator (`involvedCameraCount`, §9.1) tracks
  the **enabled** camera count, not the total.

---

## 6. Resolution control

- `voxelSize` default **0.5 m**; slider range **0.1 – 1.0 m**.
- `voxelSize` is fixed at `init()`, so changing it triggers a full re-run of
  `init` → `loadScene` → `setSampling` (scene mesh is cached and reused).
- The slider is **debounced**; the UI shows an estimated voxel count for the
  chosen size and warns near the low end.
- On the CPU backend a fine grid may be slow or rejected with `SCENE_TOO_LARGE`;
  this is caught and surfaced as a message rather than left to hang.

---

## 7. Sampling

- Fixed to full volume: `setSampling({ regions: [{ type: 'full' }] })`.
- Coverage is evaluated over every valid (free-space `EMPTY_SPACE`) voxel in the
  room. Voxels inside walls/boxes are invalid and excluded by the SDK.

---

## 8. Running the calculation

- A **Run coverage** button triggers `compute()` on demand.
- An **Auto-run** checkbox next to the button, **on by default**, triggers
  `compute()` automatically whenever the result is stale (§8.1) instead of
  requiring a manual click.
- `compute({ mode: 1, onChunkDone })`:
  - streams `ChunkResult`s; the overlay is rebuilt from accumulated chunks.
  - a progress/spinner state animates while the worker runs.
- On completion the returned `CoverageSummary` populates the stats panel.

### 8.1 Stale result handling

When a result is displayed and the user then edits a camera, FOV, or the
resolution slider:

- the overlay is **dimmed** and a **"Recompute"** badge appears,
- with Auto-run off, no automatic recompute — the user presses Run again;
- with Auto-run on (the default), a recompute is triggered automatically. It's
  **throttled to at most 10 runs/sec** (a fixed 100 ms poll checks staleness
  and fires the next run only once the previous one has finished), so rapid
  edits — e.g. dragging a camera gizmo — don't queue up overlapping computes.
  Auto-run does **not** retry after a run ends in error (§11); the user must
  press Run again to retry, same as the off case.

Camera edits require only `setCameras(...)` + `compute(...)` (no re-init).
Resolution edits require the full re-init pipeline (§6).

---

## 9. Coverage visualization

The coverage field is drawn with the **voxel volumetric renderer** — a
visualization-agnostic primitive that takes, per voxel, a `{center, size, intensity,
color}` and draws it as additive volumetric fog. Its technical design (shader,
chord-length math, compositing, tests) lives in
[`volumetric_rendering.md`](./volumetric_rendering.md). **This section owns the
visualization**: which voxels are fed to the renderer and how coverage data maps to
each voxel's `intensity` and `color`. Domain terms are defined in §13.

Voxels are extracted from streamed `ChunkResult`s using
`accessor(result).forEachLeaf((min, size, mask, valid) => …)` and fed into the
renderer incrementally as chunks arrive. Each valid leaf becomes one voxel at world
position `min` with edge `size`; `intensity` and `color` depend on the active mode.

### 9.1 Visualization modes

A **mode selector** switches between two mappings from coverage data to the
renderer's per-voxel inputs:

- **Coverage** — the default. **Every valid voxel** is fed. `color` = the
  user-selected **overlay color** (§9.2); `intensity` = the voxel's **coverage
  fraction** (`popcount(mask) / involvedCameraCount`, 0..1, §13). Well-covered
  regions glow bright/solid; weakly covered regions are faint; blind spots
  (fraction 0) contribute nothing and are invisible. This shows **where coverage
  is**.
- **Blind spots** — **only blind-spot voxels** (`mask == 0`, valid) are fed.
  `color` = the same user-selected **overlay color**; `intensity` = 1 (a fixed full
  value, since coverage fraction is 0 here and would otherwise render nothing).
  Uncovered space glows against the scene. This shows **where coverage is absent** —
  the complement of the coverage mode.

Both modes draw with the same **overlay color** (§9.2); the color is a purely
aesthetic global, independent of mode. What each mode encodes is *which* voxels are
shown and how coverage maps to `intensity`, not hue.

The two modes are mutually exclusive; the coverage-fraction denominator
(`involvedCameraCount`) tracks the **enabled** camera count (§5.4).

### 9.2 Controls

`OverlayControls.tsx`, deliberately minimal:

- **Show overlay** — visibility on/off.
- **Mode** — Coverage / Blind spots.
- **Overlay color** — a hue slider over the full spectrum (0..360°) that sets the fog
  color used by **both** modes. The color is `hsl(hue, 100%, 50%)` — full-saturation,
  so the slider sweeps a clean rainbow; it defaults to **red** (`hue = 0`). Rendered
  with a rainbow-gradient track. Sits immediately **before** Intensity scale.
- **Intensity scale** — the renderer's global brightness multiplier
  (`intensityScale`).

The overlay color is a single user-picked hue shared by both modes (the mode fixes
*which* voxels and the `intensity` mapping, not the hue). The old flat overlay's
"blind spots only" / "hide well-covered" toggles are subsumed by the mode selector;
blind-spot counts also remain available numerically in the stats panel (§10).

---

## 10. Stats panel

From `CoverageSummary`:

- `overallRate` — fraction of valid voxels seen by ≥ 1 camera.
- `perCamera[]` — per-camera `coverageRate`, listed alongside each camera.
  Disabled cameras (§5.4) aren't sent to the engine, so they have no entry here.
- `validVoxels`, `elapsedMs`.
- **Blind-spot count** — number of valid voxels no enabled camera sees (§13),
  derived as `round(validVoxels × (1 − overallRate))`. Surfaced here numerically so
  the count is available regardless of the active visualization mode (§9.1).
- Active **compute** backend (WebGPU / CPU, §3.2) and **render** backend
  (WebGPU / WebGL2, §2.3), plus current `voxelSize` / voxel count.

---

## 11. Error handling

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| `WEBGPU_UNAVAILABLE` on `auto` init (compute) | fall back to CPU (§3.2) |
| WebGPU renderer unavailable | automatic WebGL2 fallback in `WebGPURenderer` (§2.3); no error surfaced |
| `SCENE_TOO_LARGE` (fine voxel on CPU) | catch, show message, keep previous valid state |
| `CAMERA_INSIDE_GEOMETRY` | surface which camera; keep it flagged in the list (disabled cameras are excluded, so never flagged) |
| `TOO_MANY_CAMERAS` | not reachable (10 ≤ 128), but guarded |
| Worker/device errors | reported in a status area; engine re-init offered |

---

## 12. Out of scope / future

- Mode 2 (coverage-count thresholding), per-camera coverage isolation view.
- Height-band / box sampling regions as a live control.
- Scene editing (adding/removing boxes), mesh import.
- Persisting camera layouts.

---

## 13. Terminology

Canonical domain language for the app. The rendering primitive that draws the
visualization is described in
[`volumetric_rendering.md`](./volumetric_rendering.md); it is deliberately
coverage-agnostic and defines only its own generic terms (voxel intensity, color).

- **Coverage** — whether, and by how many cameras, a given voxel of free space can
  be seen. The SDK produces, per valid voxel, a **camera bitmask** (which of the
  enabled cameras see it) plus a **valid** flag. Coverage is the app's fundamental
  quantity.
- **Coverage fraction** — for one voxel, `popcount(mask) / involvedCameraCount`: the
  share of the enabled ("involved") cameras that can see it. Ranges 0 (blind spot)
  to 1 (seen by every enabled camera). Normalized, not a raw count. In the Coverage
  visualization mode (§9.1) it maps to the renderer's per-voxel intensity.
- **Blind spot** — a valid free-space voxel that no enabled camera sees (coverage
  fraction 0). Invisible in the Coverage mode; surfaced by the dedicated Blind spots
  mode (§9.1) and numerically in the stats panel (§10).
